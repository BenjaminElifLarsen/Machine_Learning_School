Case:
Identity birds using features extracted from bird songs. 





Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fleanend/birds-songs-numeric-dataset
which is based upon
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/british-birdsong-dataset

To do:
If given enough time extract the features by self.
Also, try and figure out a way to identity birds using non-negative matrix factorisation.
The problem that was encounted with the NMF was figuring a good way to do the classification.
The NMF would generate atoms, W, and activations, H, that is the estimated spectrogram of the original spectrogram.
The idea was to group all songs together by species and run them through an unsupervised NMF. 
Then add all the atoms, over all species, together to create a bird song atom corpus. 
This corpus would then be fed to a NMF, thus it being supervised, together with unknown bird song spectrograms (one at a time).
This will return the atoms, and also a new matrix of activations. 
This activation matrix will let us know which atoms are active and since it is known which atoms belong to which species it should be possible to identity the birds.
The problem is just how to best fed this data to a classifer, since we do not have an activation matrix for the training set.
