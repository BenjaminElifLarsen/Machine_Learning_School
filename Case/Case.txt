Identity birds out from their songs.

Using Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF).

Firstly it is trained on the spectrogram of multiple birds to generate the needed atom matrixs for each species.
All of the atoms are then added together to a single matrix, a corpus, that will be used for the testing. 
This will mean that the NMF will apply the atoms that it thinks are most fitting the current spectrogram. 
Since it is known which atoms and their activations belong to which bird species it is possible to give the atoms and activations a to a classifier. 



--Problems--

It is hard to say how many atoms it will need in the training and testing
Looking at some spectrograms there do not seem to be obvious number.

Some of the
