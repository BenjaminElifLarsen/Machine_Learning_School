red/blue dragon kills seems to be 0 most of the time, if not all.
matchId is most likely useless, since it is just an id.

what could have high correlation
gold and minion kills (I think killing minions gives gold)
gold and wins (gold can buy stuff to help win and get more kills with)
level and champion kills (gain experience from killing other players)
gold/minion
gold/win
minon/win
level/champion
level/win
champion/level
